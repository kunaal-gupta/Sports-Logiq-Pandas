    "Hi and welcome to the Sportlogiq DA Questionnaire! The goal with this questionnaire is to assess your problem solving, hockey knowledge, and coding/stats abilities and your (hopeful) fit with some of our day-to-day tasks. If you find yourself stuck or unsure on a question, showing your work and explaining your problem solving/decision making is still highly recommended.\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries:\n",
    "- You'll want to import libraries such as numpy, pandas, a plotting library like plotly/matplotlib, and a stats library of your choosing (sklearn for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Info:\n",
    "- There are two data files. One has a condensed event set from a randomly chosen hockey game and the other contains Expected Goals values (xg) provided only for shots that successfully hit the net. If an xg value doesn't correspond to a shot event, it should not be counted\n",
    "\n",
    "- X and Y Coordinates are in Feet and are adjusted such that both teams shoot in the same direction\n",
    "\n",
    "- Line Carry events are tagged when the puck is carried over either blue line or the centre ice red line\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binary columns that have values of 0 or 1 indicate 0=No, 1=Yes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Successfull passes are completed passes, successful shots are shots on net\n",
